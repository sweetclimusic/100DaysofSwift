# Chapter 4.1 - Schedulers (Finish)
Schedulers allow you to orchestrate where and when to publish, and Knowing how to queue your upstream publishers, or downstream subscription streams, whether they should be processing in the background, in your main thread, sequence serially or concurrently. When using Combine to update your applicationâ€™s UI elements, it is crucial you optimize your streams to use the main thread, but to also not degrade the user experiences.
